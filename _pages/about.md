I am a computational microscopist dedicated to understanding biology at the convergence of molecular structure, cellular context, and systems dynamics. My research vision revolves around mapping the intricate choreography of biomolecules particularly RNA-protein assemblies in their native environments, leveraging advanced electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), and integrative computational frameworks.

Currently a Scientist at Thermo Fisher Scientific, my role bridges academia and industry, driving innovation in cryo-electron tomography, multimodal electron microscopy techniques such as 4D-STEM, and computational tools for structural biology. I am transitioning towards an independent academic career, establishing the RNA Cartography Lab, a modular, collaborative, and community-oriented research platform dedicated to visualizing and understanding the mRNA lifecycle at a systems scale.

Foundations and Early Career
======
My academic journey began in physics, leading naturally into structural biology driven by a fascination for biological complexity. My early research in Mumbai combined macromolecular X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations to explore protein dynamics, DNA-protein interactions, and protein folding mechanisms. Supported by a Swiss Government Excellence Fellowship, my subsequent work at the University of Geneva focused on chromatin-associated machinery, merging biochemistry, molecular biology, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-EM.

These experiences built my interdisciplinary foundations and instilled a conviction in the necessity of observing biomolecular assemblies within their native cellular contexts a realization that led me directly to cryo-electron tomography.

Advancing Cryo-Electron Tomography
------
At the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, supported by an IMPRS-LS Ph.D. fellowship, I advanced the capabilities of cryo-ET through methodological and computational innovations. My work on ribosome biogenesis revealed spatial maturation gradients within the nucleolus, demonstrating the potential of quantitative subtomogram averaging. I co-developed open-source computational pipelines like TOMOMAN and STOPGAP, now widely utilized for high-resolution subtomogram averaging and classification.

Building further on these computational advances, I spearheaded efforts to integrate deep learning with cryo-ET, notably through the development of cryoDRGN-ET, enabling the visualization of biomolecular dynamics directly within cells. Parallel to computational work, I optimized experimental techniques, pioneering multishot tomography for high-throughput data collection and refined cryo-FIB milling techniques, enabling unprecedented in situ resolution.

Bridging Academia and Industry
------
Collaborations with Thermo Fisher Scientific during my doctoral studies led to significant advances in cryo-ET instrumentation, including the integration of energy filters, direct electron detectors, and novel cryo-FIB milling approaches. My subsequent formal role at Thermo Fisher has deepened my expertise in translating academic research needs into tangible technological innovations.

RNA Cartography Lab and Open Science Initiatives
======
Driven by my experience with large-scale collaborative visual proteomics projects including pioneering community-driven datasets such as the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii visual proteomics dataset I am establishing the RNA Cartography Lab. This initiative will leverage modular, scalable, and collaborative approaches to uncover the complexity of the mRNA lifecycle, positioning itself at the intersection of computational biology, in situ structural biology, and systems biology.

Teaching and Mentorship
======
Throughout my career, I have been deeply committed to scientific training and mentorship, teaching advanced cryo-EM methods internationally (EMBO, SPACET, Human Technopole) and actively mentoring junior scientists through workshops and practical courses. My ongoing contributions to educational initiatives such as the inaugural Rio School of CryoET further reflect my dedication to empowering the next generation of structural biologists.

Looking Ahead
======
The unconventional path of my career bridging physics, biology, computational and technological innovation, and industry collaboration has uniquely prepared me for scientific leadership. I am committed to build dynamic research communities and continue developing enabling technologies to visualize and understand RNA life cycle at the molecular and systems scale.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

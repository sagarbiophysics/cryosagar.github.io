I am a computational microscopist exploring how molecular structure and cellular organization shape biological systems. My research focuses on decoding the mRNA life cycle as a spatially organized, structurally dynamic system, using cutting-edge methods including cellular cryo-electron tomography, advanced multimodal microscopy, and integrative computational analysis.

In my current role as a Scientist at Thermo Fisher Scientific, I bridge academic innovation with industry-driven technological development, advancing methodologies in cryo-electron tomography, 4D-STEM, cryoFIB-SEM, and next-generation cellular imaging.

I am now transitioning to an independent academic position by establishing the [RNAcartography](/initiatives/1-RNAcartography) initiative. This initiative aims to map the mRNA lifecycle directly within cells by integrating visual proteomics, high-resolution imaging, and systems-level analysis. The initiative builds upon my foundational computational and experimental innovations; including multishot tomography, cryo-FIB milling optimizations, and quantitative subtomogram averaging and classification; which enabled insights into ribosome biogenesis, translational dynamics, and spatial organization.

My scientific journey, spanning physics, structural biology, cell biology, computational methods, and technological innovation, uniquely prepares me for leadership in cross-disciplinary and community-driven science. I am dedicated to cultivating open and collaborative research environments, developing modular and accessible technologies, and pioneering integrative approaches to unravel the full cellular complexity of mRNA biology.

Curious about how I got here? Read [Tracing an Unconventional Path: My Journey in Science..._So Far_](/posts/2025/06/blog-post-biosketch/), a personal reflection on the winding path through physics, structural biology, cryo-electron tomography, and cell biology that shaped my scientific approach and led to [RNAcartography](/initiatives/1-RNAcartography).

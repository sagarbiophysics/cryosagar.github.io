	abstract = {In situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as the method of choice to investigate structures of biomolecules in their native context. However, challenges remain in the efficient production of large-scale cryo-ET datasets, as well as the community sharing of this information-rich data. Here, we applied a cryogenic plasma-based focused ion beam (cryo-PFIB) instrument for high-throughput milling of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a useful model organism for in situ visualization of numerous fundamental cellular processes. Combining cryo-PFIB sample preparation with recent advances in cryo-ET data acquisition and processing, we generated a dataset of 1829 reconstructed and annotated tomograms, which we provide as a community resource to drive method development and inspire biological discovery. To assay the quality of this dataset, we performed subtomogram averaging (STA) of both soluble and membrane-bound complexes ranging in size from {\textgreater}3 MDa to ∼200 kDa, including 80S ribosomes, Rubisco, nucleosomes, microtubules, clathrin, photosystem II, and mitochondrial ATP synthase. The majority of these density maps reached sub-nanometer resolution, demonstrating the potential of this C. reinhardtii dataset, as well as the promise of modern cryo-ET workflows and open data sharing towards visual proteomics.},

This enables the structural characterization of molecules in their near-native environments, without the need for purification or separation, thereby preserving biological information such as conformational states and spatial relationships between different molecular species. Subtomogram averaging is an image-processing workflow that allows users to leverage cryo-ET data to identify and localize target molecules, determine high-resolution structures of repeating molecular species and classify different conformational states. Here, STOPGAP, an open-source package for subtomogram averaging that is designed to provide users with fine control over each of these steps, is described. In providing detailed descriptions of the image-processing algorithms that STOPGAP uses, this manuscript is also intended to serve as a technical resource to users as well as for further community-driven software development.},

	abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been established as a routine method for protein structure determination during the past decade, taking an ever-increasing share of published structural data. Recent advances in TEM technology and automation have boosted both the speed of data collection and quality of acquired images while simultaneously decreasing the required level of expertise for obtaining cryo-EM maps at sub-3 \&\#197; resolutions. While most of such high-resolution structures have been obtained using state-of-the-art 300 kV cryo-TEM systems, high-resolution structures can be also obtained with 200 kV cryo-TEM systems, especially when equipped with an energy filter. Additionally, automation of microscope alignments and data collection with real-time image quality assessment reduces system complexity and assures optimal microscope settings, resulting in increased yield of high-quality images and overall throughput of data collection. This protocol demonstrates the implementation of recent technological advances and automation features on a 200 kV cryo-transmission electron microscope and shows how to collect data for the reconstruction of 3D maps that are sufficient for de novo atomic model building. We focus on best practices, critical variables, and common issues that must be considered to enable the routine collection of such high-resolution cryo-EM datasets. Particularly the following essential topics are reviewed in detail: i) automation of microscope alignments, ii) selection of suitable areas for data acquisition, iii) optimal optical parameters for high-quality, high-throughput data collection, iv) energy filter tuning for zero-loss imaging, and v) data management and quality assessment. Application of the best practices and improvement of achievable resolution using an energy filter will be demonstrated on the example of apo-ferritin that was reconstructed to 1.6 \&\#197;, and Thermoplasma acidophilum 20S proteasome reconstructed to 2.1-\&\#197; resolution using a 200 kV TEM equipped with an energy filter and a direct electron detector.},

While cryo-ET can reveal structures at molecular resolution, image processing algorithms remain a bottleneck in resolving the heterogeneity of biomolecular structures in situ. Here, we introduce cryoDRGN-ET for heterogeneous reconstruction of cryo-ET subtomograms. CryoDRGN-ET learns a deep generative model of three-dimensional density maps directly from subtomogram tilt-series images and can capture states diverse in both composition and conformation. We validate this approach by recovering the known translational states in Mycoplasma pneumoniae ribosomes in situ. We then perform cryo-ET on cryogenic focused ion beam–milled Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. CryoDRGN-ET reveals the structural landscape of S. cerevisiae ribosomes during translation and captures continuous motions of fatty acid synthase complexes inside cells. This method is openly available in the cryoDRGN software.},

	abstract = {Peb4 from Campylobacter jejuni is an intertwined dimeric, periplasmic holdase, which also exhibits peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. Peb4 gene deletion alters the outer membrane protein profile and impairs cellular adhesion and biofilm formation for C. jejuni. Earlier crystallographic study has proposed that the PPIase domains are flexible and might form a cradle for holding the substrate and these aspects of Peb4 were explored using sub-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations in solution environment. Our simulations have revealed that PPIase domains are highly flexible and undergo a large structural change where they move apart from each other by 8 nm starting at .5 nm. Further, this large conformational change renders Peb4 as a compact protein with crossed-over conformation, forms a central cavity, which can “cradle” the target substrate. As reported for other chaperone proteins, flexibility of linker region connecting the chaperone and PPIase domains is key to forming the “crossed-over” conformation. The conformational transition of the Peb4 protein from the X-ray structure to the crossed-over conformation follows the “mother’s arms” chain model proposed for the FkpA chaperone protein. Our results offer insights into how Peb4 and similar chaperones can use the conformational heterogeneity at their disposal to perform its much-revered biological function.},

This structure shows the stalk region and the essential N-terminal region (NTR) previously unseen in our DNA unbound structure. The flexible nature of the NTR in solution was confirmed using SAXS. Thermofluor studies performed to assess the stability of RecU in complex with the arms of an HJ indicate that it confers stability. Further, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of wild type and an NTR deletion variant of RecU, with and without HJ. The NTR is observed to be highly flexible in simulations of the unbound RecU, in agreement with SAXS observations. These simulations revealed domain dynamics of RecU and their role in the formation of complex with HJ. The MD simulations also elucidate key roles of the NTR, stalk region, and breathing motion of RecU in the formation of the reactive state.},

	abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology by providing high-resolution insights into biological macromolecules. Here, we present sub-3 Å resolution structures determined using the 100 keV Tundra cryogenic transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM), equipped with the newly developed Falcon C direct electron detector (DED). Our results demonstrate that this lower voltage microscope, when combined with advanced electron optics and detectors, can achieve high-resolution reconstructions that were previously only attainable with higher voltage systems. The implementation of an extreme-brightness field emission gun (XFEG) and an SP-TWIN objective lens significantly enhanced the spatial and temporal coherence of the system. Furthermore, the semi-automated sample loader minimized contamination and drift, allowing extended data collection sessions without manual intervention. The high detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of Falcon C further improved the signal-to-noise ratio, which is critical for achieving high-resolution structures. We validated the performance of this microscope by determining the structures of various biological samples, including apoferritin, T20S proteasome, GABAA receptor, haemoglobin, and human transthyretin ranging in size from 440 kDa to 50 kDa. The highest resolutions achieved were 2.1 Å for apoferritin, 2.7 Å for the 20S proteasome, 2.8 Å for the GABAA receptor, 5.0 Å for haemoglobin, and 3.5 Å for transthyretin. We also explored a larger specimen, a 3.9 MDa Adeno-associated virus (AAV9) capsid and resolved it a 2.8 Å. This work highlights the potential of 100 keV TEMs to make high-resolution cryo-EM more accessible to the structural biology community. Furthermore, it sets a precedent for the use of lower voltage TEMs in routine cryo-EM studies, not only for screening grids for single particle analysis but also for achieving high-resolution structures of protein samples.},

To date, the extent of the deep learning methods constructed for this problem is limited to conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Identifying macromolecules of different types and sizes is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we employ a capsule-based architecture to automate the task of macromolecule identification, that we refer to as 3D-UCaps. In particular, the architecture is composed of three components: feature extractor, capsule encoder, and CNN decoder. The feature extractor converts voxel intensities of input sub-tomograms to activities of local features. The encoder is a 3D Capsule Network (CapsNet) that takes local features to generate a low-dimensional representation of the input. Then, a 3D CNN decoder reconstructs the sub-tomograms from the given representation by upsampling.},

Four different soak times of 2, 4, 7 and 10 hours were used. The five crystal structures (including the native lysozyme), refined to 1.6 Å resolution, reveal that as the soaking time increased, more and more first-shell water molecules are replaced by urea. The number of hydrogen bonds between urea and the protein is similar to that between protein and water molecules replaced by urea. However, the number of van der Waals contacts to protein from urea is almost double that between the protein and the replaced water. The hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions are initially greater with the backbone and later with side chains of charged residues. Urea altered the water-water hydrogen bond network both by replacing water solvating hydrophobic residues and by shortening the first-shell intra-water hydrogen bonds by 0.2 Å. These interaction data suggest that urea uses both ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ mechanisms to unfold lysozyme. Specific structural changes constitute the first steps in lysozyme unfolding by urea.},

In recent years, single particle analysis (SPA) has yielded molecular resolution structures of several pre-ribosomal intermediates. It falls short, however, of revealing the spatiotemporal sequence of ribosome biogenesis in the cellular context. Here, we present our study on native nucleoli in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which we follow the formation of LSU and SSU precursors by in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA).

	abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become an indispensable technique for determining three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules. A critical aspect of achieving high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions is accurately determining and correcting for the microscope's contrast transfer function (CTF). The CTF introduces defocus-dependent distortions during imaging; if not properly accounted for, the CTF can distort features in and limit the resolution of 3D reconstructions. For tilt-series data used in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), CTF estimation becomes even more challenging due to the tilt of the specimen, which introduces a defocus gradient across the field of view, as well as the low dose and signal in individual tilt images. Here, we describe a simple algorithm to improve the accuracy of CTF estimation of tilted images by leveraging the tilt-series alignment parameters determined for tomographic reconstruction to explicitly account for the tilted specimen geometry. In brief, each tilt image is divided into patches, each of which are then stretched according to their defocus shift. These are then summed to provide a coherent power spectrum at the tilt axis, which can then be used in standard CTF estimation algorithms. This uses all the data in each image to enhance the visibility of Thon rings, thereby improving high-resolution CTF estimation and subsequent enhancements in the resolution of subtomogram averages.},

	abstract = {Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA) are becoming the preferred methodologies for investigating subcellular and macromolecular structures in native or near-native environments. Although cryo-ET is amenable to a wide range of biological problems, these problems often have data-processing requirements that need to be individually optimized, precluding the notion of a one-size-fits-all processing pipeline. Cryo-ET data processing is also becoming progressively more complex due to the increasing number of packages for each processing step. Though each package has its strengths and weaknesses, independent development and different data formats make them difficult to interface with one another. TOMOMAN (TOMOgram MANager) is an extensible package for streamlining the interoperability of packages, enabling users to develop project-specific processing workflows. TOMOMAN does this by maintaining an internal metadata format and wrapping external packages to manage and perform preprocessing, from raw tilt-series data to reconstructed tomograms. TOMOMAN can also export these metadata between various STA packages. TOMOMAN includes tools for archiving projects to data repositories, allowing subsequent users to download TOMOMAN projects and directly resume processing. By tracking essential metadata, TOMOMAN streamlines data sharing, which improves the reproducibility of published results, reduces computational costs by minimizing reprocessing, and enables the distribution of cryo-ET projects between multiple groups and institutions. TOMOMAN provides a way for users to test different software packages in order to develop processing workflows that meet the specific needs of their biological questions and to distribute their results to the broader scientific community.},

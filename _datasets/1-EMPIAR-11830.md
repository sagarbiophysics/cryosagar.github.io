One of the largest open cryo-ET datasets generated using cryo-FIB milled vitrified <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em> cells.

We created this dataset for our pioneering efforts in [large-scale collaborative cryo-ET](/publication/2024-12-01-Towards-community-driven-visual-proteomics-with-large-scale-cryo-electron-tomography-of-Chlamydomonas-reinhardtii). This in turn resulted in a domino effect allowing us to visualize [mitochondrial respiratory chain in native context](/publication/2025-03-01-In-cell-architecture-of-the-mitochondrial-respiratory-chain) and further ongoing work. 

This has also helped other method developers in the field, especially in applications of Artificial Inteligence to cryo-ET. For example, this [amazing work](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.16.633326v1.abstract) by [Mart Last](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H18PWjYAAAAJ&hl=nl).

Access this dataset on [EMPIAR](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-11830/).

You can also access this dataset and visualize associated annotations on [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative data portal](https://cryoetdataportal.czscience.com/datasets/10302?author=khavnekar)

Comming soon to the cloud, so we can truely enter the era of colaborative cryo-ET.

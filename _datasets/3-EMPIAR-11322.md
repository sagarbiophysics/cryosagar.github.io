This is one of the unique experimental datasets for computational methods development in cryo-ET. It is acquired on a vitrified sample containing a mixture of purified 70S Ribosomes, 20S Proteasomes, and gold fiducials. We created this dataset for specific needs of developing [subtomogram based tilt-series refinement within the STOPGAP framework](https://academic.oup.com/mam/article-abstract/27/S1/3240/6889264). Subsequently, we used this dataset as benchmark while developing [Multishot Tomography](/publication/2023-03-01-Multishot-tomography-for-high-resolution-in-situ-subtomogram-averaging).

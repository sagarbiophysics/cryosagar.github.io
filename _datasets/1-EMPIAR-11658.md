One of the first open cryo-ET datasets generated using cryo-plasmaFIB milled vitrified <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> cells.

We created this dataset primarily for computational methods developments. This dataset has been pivotal to development of [TOMOMAN](/publication/2024-12-01-TOMOMAN-a-software-package-for-large-scale-cryo-electron-tomography-data-preprocessing-community-data-sharing-and-collaborative-computing) and [STOPGAP](/publication/2024-05-01-STOPGAP-an-open-source-package-for-template-matching-subtomogram-alignment-and-classification) workflows. It also allowed us to demostrate the need of [tilt-corrected periodogram averaging for high resolution in-situ subtomogram averaging](/publication/2025-05-01-An-approach-for-coherent-periodogram-averaging-of-tilt-series-data-for-improved-contrast-transfer-function-estimation). In addition, ready availability of this dataset and subsequent analysis, allowed us to collaboratively develope [cryoDRGN-ET](/publication/2024-08-01-CryoDRGN-ET-deep-reconstructing-generative-networks-for-visualizing-dynamic-biomolecules-inside-cells).

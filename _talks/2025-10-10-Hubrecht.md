Invited seminar on the scientific and conceptual frontiers of cellular cryo-electron tomography and _in situ_ visual proteomics for [RNA Cartography](/initiatives/1-RNAcartography).

Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) provides a unique window into the native architecture of cells, capturing macromolecular complexes in their native context. In our large-scale cryo-ET study of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [[1]](/publication/2024-12-01-Towards-community-driven-visual-proteomics-with-large-scale-cryo-electron-tomography-of-Chlamydomonas-reinhardtii), we generated open-access dataset of ~1800 tomograms, yielding subnanometer resolution averages of canonical complexes such as ribosomes, rubisco, clathrin, microtubules, and nucleosomes. Additional investigations allowed us to visualize mitochondrial respiratory chain in its native context [[2]](/publication/2025-03-01-In-cell-architecture-of-the-mitochondrial-respiratory-chain). However, biologically critical RNP assemblies, for example, splicing complexes, mRNPs, or decay machinery remained underrepresented or ambiguous, despite the scale of the dataset.

This gap highlights a fundamental challenge: the complexity, flexibility, and heterogeneity of complexes involved in the RNA life cycle demand a shift in how we extract meaning from cryo-ET data. In recent works, I have focused on building computational frameworks for quantitative classification [[3]](/publication/2024-05-01-STOPGAP-an-open-source-package-for-template-matching-subtomogram-alignment-and-classification), structural heterogeneity [[4]](/publication/2024-08-01-CryoDRGN-ET-deep-reconstructing-generative-networks-for-visualizing-dynamic-biomolecules-inside-cells), and spatial context [[5]](/publication/2021-09-01-In-situ-cryo-electron-tomography-reveals-gradient-organization-of-ribosome-biogenesis-in-intact-nucleoli). These efforts aim to move beyond resolution-driven paradigms toward a context-aware systems-level approach to RNA biology, henceforth defined as RNA Cartography.

This emerging vision of [RNA Cartography](/initiatives/1-RNAcartography) proposes that only by integrating ab initio detection and flexible modeling, contextual and statistical analysis, and post hoc correlation with imaging-based Omics can we begin to map the comprehensive organizational landscape of the RNA life cycle in situ. I will discuss methodological advances and conceptual drivers that underpin this shift, and how we might collectively define a roadmap toward quantitative structural systems biology of the RNA world.
